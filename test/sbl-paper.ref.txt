PRIMARY HEADING
LONG TITLES ARE SINGLE-SPACED ON SUBSEQUENT LINES

The top margin is two inches for the first page only. There are two blank lines between the title
and the text (or subheading if there is one). The left, right, top, and bottom margins are one inch.
The first pages of chapters are formatted like the primary heading.
Indent the first line of subsequent paragraphs. All main text should be set in a standard
12-point font such as Times-New-Roman.

First-Level Subheading
Keep two blank lines between the text of the preceding section and a subheading, regardless of
the level. A first level subheading is centered, bold, and capitalized headline style.

Second-Level Subheading
There are two blank lines between the text of the preceding section and the subheading. A
second-level subheading is centered and capitalized headline style.

Third-Level Subheading
A third level subheading is on the left margin, in bold, italics, and capitalized headline style. A
heading should never be the last text on a page. If necessary, add extra blank space at the end of
the page and begin the following page with a heading.

2
Fourth-Level Subheading
A fourth-level subheading is on the left margin, capitalized headline style.
The page numbers for the noninitial pages of the paper (or chapter) are located at the top
right corner. The text of the body of the paper is double-spaced except for blocked quotations.
This is a blocked quotation. It should consist of five or more lines of text and be indented
one-half inch. Block quotations should be single-spaced. No quotation marks are used at
the beginning or the end of the quote. Double quotation marks within the original
matter are retained. The blocked quote is set off by a regular double space before and
after the quote. Note that regular spacing resumes after the end of the quotation.1
After a block quotation, return to double-spaced text justified to the left margin until you finish
the paragraph.
Footnotes at the bottom of the page are separated by a two-inch rule.2 Maintain
subsequent numbering in notes. Make sure a footnote and the text to which it refers are on the
same page.

CITATIONS

Citations should be referenced using \autocite or \autocites for citations in footnotes and
\parencite or \parencites for citations in parentheses. For example, here is a dictionary
with a shorthand: (NIDNTT). Here’s a commentary,3 and here’s the same article referenced in
two different publications.4

1. The first line of a footnote is indented one-half inch. A 10-point font is acceptable. Footnotes, unlike the
main text of the paper, should be single-spaced.
2. There should be a blank line between each note and a blank en space between the number and the first
word of the note.

GREEK AND HEBREW

Paragraph Greek:
Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος. (John 1:1)
Paragraph Hebrew:
(Gen 1:1) .‫בּ ֵראשׁית בּ ָרא ֱאֹלִהים ֵאת ַהשַׁמ ִים ְוֵאת ָהָא ֶרץ‬
Inline Greek (Ἐν ἀρχῇ), transliterated Greek (En archē), Hebrew (‫)בראשית‬, and transliterated
Hebrew (bərēʾšı̂t ).

APPENDIX 1: APPENDIX TITLE

There should be two blank lines between the title and the text.
Each appendix should have a number and a title, unless there is only one appendix, in
which case the appendix does not need a number. Every appendix requires a heading, so if you
are including a preexisting document you will need to type a heading (i.e., the appendix number
and title) on that document so that it conforms to your numbered appendixes.
An appendix is formatted like the first page of a chapter, using a two-inch top margin.
Locate page numbers at the bottom center of the first page of each appendix and at the top right
corner of subsequent pages. If the appendix is already numbered, put those page numbers in
square brackets. Page numbering for the appendixes is consecutive with the rest of the paper.
Margins for the appendixes should be the same as the rest of the paper. You may need to
reduce the content of the appendix to fit the margins.
