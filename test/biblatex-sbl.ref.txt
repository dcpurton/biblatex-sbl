1 Introduction
provides support to biblatex and LaTeX for citations, bibliography, and a
list of abbreviations in the style recommended by the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL).
The style conforms to the second edition of the SBLHS.
The style supports all examples given in the handbook (see biblatex-sbl-examples.pdf).
Shorthand citations and a list of abbreviations containing journals, series, and shorthands
are handled automatically. Repeated authors in the bibliography are replaced by a horizontal
line. Ibidem and idem is enabled by default. Indexing of names is supported, but not enabled
by default. Only note style citations, not Author-Date citations are supported. Primary
sources can be cited in parentheses. biblatex-sbl is compatible with biblatex’s support
for hyperref.
For anything not covered in this manual, please see the biblatex documentation. Bugs
and feature requests can be submitted at https://github.com/dcpurton/biblatex-sbl/.
Note: This package should be considered as beta software and its output carefully
checked when you use it.
biblatex-sbl

2 Requirements
requires at least version 3.11 of biblatex and the xparse package. biber
must be used. bibtex is not supported. For localization babel (not polyglossia) and
csquotes are recommended.
biblatex-sbl

1

3 Usage
The following minimal example will set up biblatex-sbl to conform to the defaults of the
SBLHS.
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[style=sbl]{biblatex}
\addbibresource{<bibfile.bib>}
\begin{document}
\printbiblist{abbreviations}
\printbibliography
\end{document}

3.1 Localization
By default biblatex-sbl uses American style punctuation and quotation marks. You can
choose a different style by including the babel and csquotes packages in your document
preamble. polyglossia is not well supported by biblatex and its use is discouraged.
\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}
\usepackage{csquotes}
\usepackage[style=sbl]{biblatex}

Currently english (including variants such as british, australian, etc.), spanish, and
german are supported.
For Greek and especially Hebrew, the set up is more complicated and you should use
xelatex or lualatex. See sbl-paper.pdf for example Greek and Hebrew usage with babel.
\usepackage[nil,bidi=default]{babel}
\usepackage{csquotes}
\babelprovide[import=en-US,main]{american}
\babelprovide[import=he]{hebrew}
\babelprovide[import=el]{polutonikogreek}
\babelfont[american]{rm}[Ligatures=TeX]{Linux Libertine O}
\babelfont[hebrew]{rm}%
[Ligatures=TeX,Contextuals=Alternate]{SBL BibLit}
\babelfont[polutonikogreek]{rm}%
[Ligatures=TeX,Contextuals=Alternate]{SBL BibLit}

3.2 Commands
The standard commands for biblatex-sbl generally follow those defined by biblatex.
Included below are the most typical commands. For more commands and options, reference
the biblatex manual.
\autocite[hprenotei][(haltpostnotei)hpostnotei]{hkeyi}

inserts a citation as a footnote. If used in a footnote, the citation is placed
in parentheses. It works as in the standard biblatex styles, except that that postnote
argument can be divided into two using parentheses. This creates an altpostnote field
which is used in some of the examples from §6.4 of the SBLHS. e.g.,

\autocite

\autocite[See][(1.3)8:223]{clementinehomilies}

1. See The Clementine Homilies 1.3 (ANF 8:223).
To use only altpostnote surround the whole argument in parentheses. e.g.,
\autocite[(III. 1-164)]{PGM:betz}

1. PGM III. 1–164 (Betz).
\cite[hprenotei][(haltpostnotei)hpostnotei]{hkeyi}

works in the same way as \autocite except that the citation is placed directly into
the text instead of in a footnote.

\cite

\parencite[hprenotei][(haltpostnotei)hpostnotei]{hkeyi}

works in the same way as \autocite except that the citation is placed inside
parentheses instead of in a footnote. This is most useful for citing primary sources. e.g.,

\parencite

\parencite[2.233-235]{josephus:ant}

(Josephus, Ant. 2.233–235)
\journalcite{hkeyi}
\seriescite{hkeyi}
\shorthandcite{hkeyi}
\journalcite, \seriescite,

and \shorthandcite inserts the respective abbreviation into
the text and also adds it to the list of abbreviations. The abbreviation is hyperlinked to the
list of abbreviations if the hyperref package is loaded.

These commands ignore the prenote and postnote fields, so can safely be used anywhere
within a database entry.

3

\printbiblist

This command prints a bibliography list. In biblatex-sbl all abbreviations (journals, series,
and shorthands) can be printed using the following command:
\printbiblist[...]{abbreviations}

See the biblatex manual for an explanation of available optional arguments.
\printbibliography

Inserts the bibliography. See the biblatex manual for an explanation of available optional
arguments.

3.3 Package Options
defaults to the recommendations of the SBL, but it also supports many of
the standard options from biblatex as well as a few custom ones outlined below.
biblatex-sbl

accessdate=true, false

default: false

The SBLHS discourages the use of access dates.¹ If they are required this option can be
passed to biblatex.
citepages=sbl, permit, omit, separate

default: sbl

Use this option to fine-tune the formatting of the pages field the first time an entry is cited.
sbl

The postnote field is not printed for first citations. e.g.,
\autocite[159]{leyerle:1993}

1. Blake Leyerle, “John Chrysostom on the Gaze,” JECS 1 (1993): 159–74.
If postnote is not a page range, then it is printed in parentheses after pages.
e.g.,
\autocite[a note]{irvine:2014}

1. Stuart A. Irvine, “Idols [ktbwnm]: A note on Hosea 13:2a,” JBL 133
(2014): 509–17 (a note).
The one exception to this is the @incommentary entry type which always
sets citepages to omit (see below) when volume is defined.²
1. See SBLHS §6.1.6, 84.
2. See Student Supplement for the SBL Handbook of Style, Second Edition, compiled by Melanie Greer Nogalski
et al., ed. Joel M. LeMon and Brennan W. Breed (Atlanta, GA: SBL Press, February 2015), §1.3.3.2, https :
//www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/SBLHSsupp2015-02.pdf.

4

permit

The postnote is printed in parentheses after the pages field. e.g.,
\autocite[245]{wildberger:1965}

1. Hans Wildberger, “Das Abbild Gottes: Gen 1:26–30,” TZ 21 (1965):
245–59, 481–501 (245).
omit

The pages field is not printed unless postnote is empty or not a page range
(in which case behaviour matches citepages=sbl). e.g.,
\autocite[5]{freedman:1977}

1. David Noel Freedman, “Pottery, Poetry, and Prophecy: An Essay on
Biblical Poetry,” JBL 96 (1977): 5.
separate

The postnote is printed in parentheses after the pages field preceeded by
the bibliography string thiscite. e.g.,
\autocite[1]{petersen:1988}

1. David L. Petersen, “Hebrew Bible Textbooks: A Review Article,” CRBR
1 (1988): 1–18 (esp. 1).
If postnote is not a page range, then firstcite is not used and the behaviour
matches citepages=sbl.
dashed=true, false

default: true

By default, this style replaces recurrent authors/editors in the bibliography by a dash so
that items by the same author or editor are visually grouped. This feature is controlled by
the package option dashed. Setting dashed=false in the preamble will disable this feature.
eprintdate=year, short, long, terse, comp, iso8601

default: comp

Similar to the date option (for details see the biblatex manual) but controls the format of
the eprintdate.
fullbibrefs=true, false

default: false

The Student Supplement for the SBLHS permits two styles for the bibliography entry for
Bible dictionaries, encyclopaedias, and multivolume commentaries for the entire Bible by
multiple authors.³
This option applies to @inreference and @incommentary entry types.
true

The bibliography entry is printed in long form. e.g.,
Stendahl, Krister. “Biblical Theology, Contemporary.” Pages 418–32 in vol. 1
of The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible. Edited by George A. Buttrick.
4 vols. New York: Abingdon, 1962.

3. Student Supplement for the SBLHS, 4–5.

5

false

The bibliography entry is printed in a short form. e.g.,
Stendahl, Krister. “Biblical Theology, Contemporary.” IDB 1:418–32.

ibidtracker=true, false, context, strict, constrict

default: constrict

This option controls the ibidem tracker. The possible choices are:
true

Enable the tracker in global mode. not tracked separately between text body
and footnotes.

false

Disable the tracker: ibid. will not be used.

context

Enable the tracker in context-sensitive mode. In this mode, citations in
footnotes and in the body text are tracked separately.

strict

Enable the tracker in strict mode. In this mode, potentially ambiguous
references are suppressed. A reference is considered ambiguous if either the
current citation (the one including the ibidem) or the previous citation (the
one the ibidem refers to) consists of a list of references.

constrict

This mode combines the features of context and strict. It also keeps track
of footnote numbers and detects potentially ambiguous references in footnotes in a stricter way than the strict option. In addition to the conditions
imposed by the strict option, a reference in a footnote will only be considered as unambiguous if the current citation and the previous citation are
given in the same footnote or in immediately consecutive footnotes.

ibidpage=true, false

default: false

The scholarly abbreviation ibidem is sometimes taken to mean both ‘same author + same
title’ and ‘same author + same title + same page’ in traditional citation schemes. By default,
this is not the case with this style because it may lead to ambiguous citations. If you
prefer the wider interpretation of ibidem, set the package option ibidpage=true or simply
ibidpage in the preamble. The default setting is ibidpage=false.
idemtracker=true, false, context, strict, constrict

default: constrict

This option controls the idem tracker. The possible choices are:
true

Enable the tracker in global mode.

false

Disable the tracker: idem will not be used.

context

Enable the tracker in context-sensitive mode. In this mode, citations in
footnotes and in the body text are tracked separately.

strict

This is an alias for true, provided only for consistency with the other trackers.
Since idem replacements do not get ambiguous in the same way as ibidem,
the strict tracking mode does not apply to them.

6

constrict

This mode is similar to context with one additional condition: a reference
in a footnote will only be considered as unambiguous if the current citation
and the previous citation are given in the same footnote.

pagetracker=true, false

default: true

This option controls whether ibidem and idem are used across page breaks or not.
true

Enable the tracker in automatic mode. This is like
twoside mode, and like page otherwise.

false

Disable the tracker.

page

Enable the tracker in page mode. In this mode, tracking works on a per-page
basis.

spread

Enable the tracker in spread mode. In this mode, tracking works on a
per-spread (double page) basis.

sblfootnotes=true, false

spread

if LaTeX is in

default: true

This option controls the style of footnotes. This option is compatible with the footmisc
package provided footmisc is loaded before biblatex.
true

Footnotes are printed with a normal number followed by a period and the
first line indented:
1. Charles H. Talbert, Reading John: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the Fourth Gospel and the Johannine Epistles (New York: Crossroad,
1992).

false

Footnotes are printed with a superscript (or whatever other default has been
set up by your style):
¹James M. Robinson and Helmut Koester, Trajectories through Early Christianity (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1971).

shorthand=true, false, short, intro

default: true

This option controls when and whether the shorthand field is used as a citation. This can
also be used as a type option or entry option. @ancienttext and @classictext entry types
ignore this option.
true

Always use the shorthand when citing the entry.

false

Never use the shorthand when citing the entry.

short

Print the full citation the first time the entry is cited. Use the shorthand on
subsequent citations.

intro

Print the full citation the first time the entry is cited followed by (henceforth
cited as shorthand). Use the shorthand on subsequent citations.

4 Database Guide
4.1 Entry Types
All standard entry types of biblatex are supported by biblatex-sbl. This section gives
an overview of entry types that are most relevant, unique to, or treated in a custom way by
biblatex-sbl.
ancienttext

This is a custom type for biblatex-sbl. It is used for the special examples in SBLHS §6.4.1,
§6.4.3 and §6.4.8.
Unless options = {skipbib=false} is set explicitly, an @ancienttext entry will not appear
in the bibliography. (Although, see ANRW entrysubtype below for an exception.) The
related field is used to refer to the entry which should appear in the bibliography instead of
the @ancienttext entry. Options can be set on the related entry using the relatedoptions
field.
The entry pointed to by related along with the postnote is printed in parentheses after the
altpostnote, editor, and translator fields if they are present. translator and editor
fields are omitted for subsequent citations. e.g.,
\autocite[319]{suppiluliumas}

1. “Suppiluliumas and the Egyptian Queen,” trans. Albrecht Goetz (ANET, 319).
2. “Suppiluliumas and the Egyptian Queen” (ANET, 319).
\printbibliography

Pritchard, James B., ed. Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament. 3rd ed.
Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969.
If the entry contains options = {skipbib=false}, then the bibliography entry will be like
Any shorthand is also printed in the same way as a @book shorthand.

@book.

The following values for the entrysubtype field are supported:
ANRW

The ANRW entrysubtype is particularly for citing ANRW as outlined in §6.4.8
of the SBLHS. In this case, the entry will appear in the bibliography. See
biblatex-sbl-examples.pdf for full details of the required database entry.

chronicle

Formats the title using an upright shape font without quotation marks.
e.g.,
\autocite[(lines 3--4)125]{esarhaddonchronicle}

1. Esarhaddon Chronicle, lines 3–4 (Albert Kirk Grayson, Assyrian and
Babylonian Chronicles, TCS 5 [Locust Valley, NY: Augustin, 1975], 125).

8

COS

Suppresses parentheses around COS and the postnote for subsequent citations. e.g.,
\autocite[44]{greathymnaten}

1. “The Great Hymn to the Aten,” trans. Miriam Lichtheim (COS 1.26:44–
46).
2. “Great Hymn to the Aten,” COS 1.26:44.
inscription

article

Similarly to entrysubtype = {chronicle}, this formats the title using an
upright shape font without quotation marks.

An article in a journal or magazine. Also use this type for review articles (SBLHS §6.3.4)
and electronic journal articles (SBLHS §6.3.10).

book A single-volume book with one or more authors where the authors share credit for the

work as a whole.
inbook A part of a book which forms a self-contained unit with its own title.
bookinbook
mvbook

This type is similar to @inbook but intended for works originally published as a stand-alone
book. The main difference is that the title is printed in italics instead of in quotation marks.
A multivolume @book.
There is one entrysubtype supported:
RIMA

The citation for RIMA (SBLHS, 97) is treated like a series with a number
when cited in full, but as a shorthand with a volume when cited in short
form. See biblatex-sbl-examples.pdf for full details.

suppbook Supplemental material in a @book. Use this for an introduction, preface or foreword written

by someone other than the author (SBLHS §6.2.14). The type field is used to specify the
type of supplementary material. See §6.2.14 of biblatex-sbl-examples.pdf. If no type is
given, then this behaves like an @inbook.
booklet
classictext

A book-like work without a formal publisher or sponsoring institution.
This type is a custom type for biblatex-sbl. It is used for the special examples in SBLHS
§6.4.2 and §§6.4.4–6.
Unless options = {skipbib=false} is set explicitly, a @classictext entry will not appear
in the bibliography. The xref field is used to refer to the entry which should appear in the
bibliography instead of the @classictext entry.
If present, the translator and series are printed in parentheses following the postnote.
e.g.,

9

\autocite[15.18-19]{tacitus:ann:jackson}

1. Tacitus, Ann. 15.18–19 (Jackson, LCL).
\printbibliography

Tacitus. The Histories and The Annals. Translated by Clifford H. Moore and John Jackson.
4 vols. LCL. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1937.
The series can be suppressed by setting options

= {useseries=false}.

If the entry contains options = {skipbib=false}, then the bibliography entry will be like
except that the title is set in italics instead of within quotation marks.

@incollection

The following values for the entrysubtype field are supported:
churchfather

Entries using the churchfather entrysubtype print the entry pointed to
by related within parentheses following the altpostnote. The postnote
field applies to the entry in related. relatedoptions can be used to control
some aspects of the formatting for the related entry. altpostnote is always
separated from the title by a space.
\autocite[(28.3.5)252]{augustine:letters}

1. Augustine, Letters of St. Augustin 28.3.5 (NPNF¹ 1:252).
\printbibliography

Augustine. The Letters of St. Augustin. In vol. 1 of The Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers, Series 1. Edited by Philip Schaff. 14 vols. 1886–1889. Repr.,
Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1994.
collection

A single-volume collection with multiple, self-contained contributions by distinct authors
which have their own title. The work as a whole has no overall author but it will usually
have an editor.

mvcollection A multi-volume @collection.
incollection

A contribution to a collection which forms a self-contained unit with a distinct author and
title.

commentary A single-volume commentary on a book (or part of a book) of the Bible by one or more

authors. This entry type is similar to @book, except that any volume and maintitle is only
printed in the bibliography, not the citation.
mvcommentary A multi-volume commentary on a single book of the Bible by one or more authors or a

multi-volume commentary on the whole Bible by multiple authors. Unlike @commentary,
this behaves exactly the same as a @mvbook.

10

incommentary A contribution to a commentary which forms a self-contained unit with a distinct author

and title. This is typically a commentary on a book of the Bible appearing in a single or
multi-volume commentary on the entire Bible.
If an entry contains an xref field, then the bibliography entry is printed in either short or
long form as described above under fullbibrefs.
conferencepaper

An unpublished paper presented at a professional society. Use the eventtitle, venue, and
date fields to specify detail for the conference. See §6.3.8 of biblatex-sbl-examples.pdf
for and example.

lexicon A single-volume lexicon or theological dictionary. This is similar to a @book.
mvlexicon

A multi-volume lexicon or theological dictionary. This is similar to a @mvbook.

inlexicon An article in a lexicon or theological dictionary. This is a custom type for biblatex-sbl.

The required xref field must contain the entry name of a @lexicon or @mvlexicon. The
entry does not appear in the bibliography. Instead the lexicon pointed to by
xref appears in the bibliography.
@inlexicon

Subsequent citations do not include the title, only the name of the lexicon (specified by
the xref entry). e.g.,
\autocite[511]{dahn+liefeld:see+vision+eye}

1. Karl Dahn and Walter L. Liefeld, “See, Vision, Eye,” NIDNTT 3:511–21.
\autocite[511]{dahn+liefeld:see+vision+eye}

2. Dahn and Liefeld, NIDNTT 3:511.
\printbibliography

Brown, Colin, ed. New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology. 4 vols. Grand
Rapids: Zondervan, 1975–1985.
misc
online

A fallback type for entries which do not fit into any other category. Use the howpublished
field to supply publishing information in free format, if applicable.
An online resource without a print counterpart. This is similar to an @article.

periodical A complete issue of a periodical, such as a special issue of a journal. The title of the

periodical is given in the title field. If the issue has its own title in addition to the main
title of the periodical, it goes in the issuetitle field.
This type could also be used to insert a journal into the list of abbreviations. In this case,
just use title, shorttitle, and set options = {skipbib}.
reference A single-volume encyclopaedia or dictionary. This is similar to a @book.

11

mvreference

A multi-volume @reference. This is similar to a @mvbook.

inreference An article in an encyclopaedia or dictionary. The required xref field must contain the entry

name of a @reference or @mvreference.
The bibliography entry is printed in either short or long form as described above under
fullbibrefs.
review A book review in a journal. This is similar to an @article. Use the revdauthor/revdeditor

and revdtitle fields to specify the author/editor and title of the book being reviewed.
Note that review articles are treated like articles and should use the @article entry type.
seminarpaper An SBL seminar paper. This is similar to an @incollection except that in is suppressed

byfore the booktitle/maintitle. See §6.4.11 of biblatex-sbl-examples.pdf for an example.
series A multi-volume series. This is similar to a @mvbook except that an upright shaped font is

used for the title field and the option field is set to {useauthor=false, useditor=false}
by default.
This type could also be used to place a series in the list of abbreviations. In this case, just
use series, shortseries, and set options = {skipbib}.

4.2 Entry Fields
supports all entry fields from the biblatex manual except for pagetotal.
There are also a number of custom entry fields and specially handled fields supported by
biblatex-sbl. These are documented below.
biblatex-sbl

bookeditor

list (name)
The editor(s) of the booktitle.
The behaviour of editor, bookeditor, and maineditor is as follows (when editor is not
used as the overall editor): editor applies to maintitle (if set) unless maineditor is set. In
this case, editor applies to booktitle (if set) unless bookeditor is set. In this case, editor
applies to title.

booktranslator list (name)

The translator(s) of the booktitle.
The behaviour of translator, booktranslator, and
editor, bookeditor, and maineditor.
eprintdate

maintranslator

is the same as for

field (date)
The date a text edition published online with no print counterpart or an article in an online
database is released. See §6.4.1 and §6.4.13 of biblatex-sbl-examples.pdf.

12

eprintday

field (datepart)
This field holds the day component of the eprintdate field.

eprintmonth field (datepart)

This field holds the month component of the eprintdate field.
eprintyear

field (datepart)
This field holds the year component of the eprintdate field.

maineditor list (name)

The editor(s) of the maintitle.
maintranslator

list (name)
The translator(s) of the maintitle.

revdauthor list (name)

The author(s) of the revdtitle.
revdeditor

list (name)
The editor(s) of the revdtitle.

revdshorttitle

field (literal)
The title of a book being review in an abridged form. This field is used in subsequent
citations of @review entry types.

revdsubtitle field (literal)

The subtitle of a book being reviewed.
revdtitle

field (literal)
The title of a book being reviewed.

revdtitleaddon field (literal)

An annex to the revdtitle, to be printed in a different font.
seriesseries

field (literal)
This field is used when a series is begun anew to distinguish between the old and new
series. See SBLHS §6.2.24.

13

shortbooktitle

field (literal)
The booktitle in abridged form.

shorthand field (literal)

A special short form printed instead of the usual citation. Sometimes the shorthand is
short for the authors and should be printed in an upright font shape. Other times it is
short for the title and should be printed in italics. This behaviour is controlled using
the shorttitle field. If the shorttitle is the same as the shorthand then the shorthand
is assumed to be short for the title and printed in italics, otherwise it is printed in an
upright font. The shorthand is automatically inserted into the list of abbreviations.
The separator between the shorthand and postnote depends on the content of the postnote.
If the postnote contains a ‘.’, ‘:’, or ‘§’, then the separator is a space, otherwise it is a comma.
shortjournal field (literal)

The journaltitle in abridged form. This is always printed instead of the journaltitle. The
shortjournal and journaltitle is then automatically inserted into the list of abbreviations.
shortmaintitle field (literal)

The maintitle in abridged form.
shortseries field (literal)

The series in abridged form. This is always printed instead of the series. The shortseries
and series is then automatically inserted into the list of abbreviations.

withauthor

list (name)
The author(s) who assist the author. See witheditortype, below, for an example.

assist the author. If unspecified, the bibliography string with is used.
witheditor list (name)

The editor(s) who assist the editor.

14

witheditortype field (literal)

The type of witheditor. This field will affect the string used to introduce the editor(s) who

4.4 Reprints
supports three different ways of doing reprints with varying complexity.
If only the original publisher, location, and/or year are required, then use the fields
origpublisher, origlocation, and origdate. e.g.,
biblatex-sbl

@book{vanseters:1997,
author = {Van Seters, John},
title = {In Search of History: Histeriography in the Ancient
World and the Origins of Biblical History},
origlocation = {New Haven},
origpublisher = {Yale University Press},
origdate = {1983},
location = {Winona Lake, IN},
publisher = {Eisenbrauns},
date = {1997}
}

\autocite[90]{vanseters:1997}

1. John Van Seters, In Search of History: Histeriography in the Ancient World
and the Origins of Biblical History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1983;
repr., Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1997), 90.
\printbibliography

Van Seters, John. In Search of History: Histeriography in the Ancient World and
the Origins of Biblical History. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1983.
Repr., Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1997.
When extra information is required, use a related entry with relatedtype = {reprint}.
A custom string can be specified instead of “Repr.” using the optional relatedstring field.
In this case no punctuation is inserted after the relatedstring. You could think of the
default being relatedstring = {\bibstring{reprint},}. e.g.,
@mvbook{sasson:2000,
editor = {Sasson, Jack M.},
title = {Civilizations of the Ancient Near East},
volumes = {4},

18

location = {New York},
publisher = {Scribner's Sons},
year = {1995},
related = {sasson:repr},
relatedtype = {reprint}
}
@mvbook{sasson:repr,
volumes = {4~vols.\ in 2},
location = {Peabody, MA},
publisher = {Hendrickson},
date = {2000}
}

\autocite[1:40]{sasson:2000}

1. Jack M. Sasson, ed., Civilizations of the Ancient Near East, 4 vols. (New
York: Scribner’s Sons, 1995; repr., 4 vols. in 2 [Peabody, MA: Hendrickson,
2000]), 1:40.
\printbibliography

Sasson, Jack M., ed. Civilizations of the Ancient Near East. 4 vols. New York:
Scribner’s Sons, 1995. Repr., 4 vols. in 2. Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2000.
A full reprint history also uses the related field, but with some other relatedtype apart
from relatedtype = {reprint}. e.g.,
@book{wellhausen:1883,
author = {Wellhausen, Julius},
title = {Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels},
edition = {2},
location = {Berlin},
publisher = {Reimer},
date = {1883}
}
@book{wellhausen:1885,
author = {Wellhausen, Julius},
title = {Prolegomena to the History of Israel},
translator = {Black, J. Sutherland and Enzies, A.},
preface = {Smith, W. Robertson},
location = {Edinburgh},
publisher = {Black},

19

related = {wellhausen:1883},
relatedtype = {translationof},
date = {1885}
}
@book{wellhausen:1957,
author = {Wellhausen, Julius},
title = {Prolegomena to the History of Ancient Israel},
location = {New York},
publisher = {Meridian Books},
related = {wellhausen:1885},
relatedtype = {reprintof},
date = {1957}
}

\autocite[20]{wellhausen:1957}

1. Julius Wellhausen, Prolegomena to the History of Ancient Israel (New
York: Meridian Books, 1957), 20; repr. of Prolegomena to the History of Israel,
trans. J. Sutherland Black and A. Enzies, with preface by W. Robertson Smith
(Edinburgh: Black, 1885); trans. of Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels, 2nd ed.
(Berlin: Reimer, 1883).
