## SBLHS Blog Tests

- @inreference
    - https://sblhs2.com/2017/08/03/corpus-caesarianum-in-bnp/

## Other Tests (TODO)

- pagination option
- citepages option
- dashed author
- ibid
- index
- inclusive numbers (SBLHS §4.2.4–4.2.7)

## Other Questions

- l. and ll. or line and lines? (cf.
  [ANET](https://sblhs2.com/2017/06/01/citing-text-collections-2-anet/) and
  [Inscriptions and
  Papyri](https://sblhs2.com/2016/10/20/inscriptions-papyri/)

## Ancient Works Examples

Author, *Title* 1.2.12, quoted in …, page

- e.g., Marius Victorinus, *Epistle to the Ephesians* 1.2.12, quoted in Mark
  J. Edwards, ed., *Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians*, ACCS New Testament 8
  (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1999), 129
- shorten the quoted in reference for subsequent citations of different works
    - e.g., Theodoret, *Epistle to the Galatians* 5.13, quoted in Edwards,
      *Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians*, 77
- Place the quoted in book in the bibliography
    - e.g., Edwards, Mark J., ed. *Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians*.  ACCS
      New Testament 8. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1999.
- presumably if the title of the ancient work is abbreviated it should go into
  the list of abbreviations

Greek Magical Papyri

- *PGM* III. 410–424
    - *PGM* goes into list of abbreviations
    - note `\mknormrange` must be used for ancient works
- *PDM* xiv. 554–562
- (*PGM* I. 195–200 [O’Neil in Betz])
    - use this form for quotes
        - O'Neil is the translator
        - Betz is the editor of the collection
        - Betz must appear in the bibliography
            - e.g., Betz, Hans Dieter, ed. *The Greek Magical Papyri in*
              *Translation, Including the Demotic Spells*. 2nd ed. Chicago:
              University of Chicago Press, 1996.

Kitchen’s *Ramesside Inscriptions*

- *KRI* 4:39, line 10
    - *KRI* goes into list of abbreviations

*NTApoc*

- For the Acts of Andrew, see *NTApoc* 2:101–51
    - title in Roman not enquoted
        - because it is a standard title
            - non-standard titles are enquoted
- quotation form
    - Mur. Frag. lines 34–39, trans. Wilhelm Schneemelcher, *NTApoc* 1:35
- *NTApoc* goes in list of abbreviations

The Muratorian Fragment

- The Epistle of Jude is referenced in Mur. Frag. 68
- Mur. Frag. line 68
    - in case of source division of line being ambiguous
- line 68 of the Muratorian Fragment

*ARAB*

- *ARAB* 2.407–16
    - why are numbers compressed?
- *ARAB* 1.265–66
- this is going to be a problem
    - since the 1 and 2 are volumes there is a space between *ARAB* and the
      volume
    - but since the numbers are paragraphs
        - SBL only uses a colon between volume and page
    - how to cite?
        - `\volcite{1.265-266}{ARAB}`?
- *ARAB* must be in list of abbreviations

*MOTP*

- For an introduction to the Apocryphon of Seth, see *MOTP* 1:33–38
- quote format
    - Bk. Noah 3; trans. Martha Himmelfarb, *MOTP* 1:46
        - why semicolon?
            - cf. ANET and COS
- *MOTP* goes into list of abbreviations

*OTP*

- For an example of an apocalypse likely written 100 BCE–70 CE, see the
  Apocalypse of Zephaniah (*OTP* 1:508–15)
- The imagery of flying angels blowing trumpets was common to apocalyptic
  literature, as in Apoc. Zeph. 9.1: “Then a great angel came forth having a
  golden trumpet in his hand, and he blew it three times over my head” (trans.
  O. S. Wintermute, *OTP* 1:514)
    - cite translator when quoting
- For a Christian insertion, see Sib. Or. 12.30–34 (*OTP* 1:445). [book +
  lines]
- Moses addresses God at the burning bush in Ezek. Trag. 90–95 (*OTP* 2:812)
  [lines]
- For the account of Levi attempting to save Pharaoh’s son, see Jos. Asen.
  29.1–6. [chapter + verses]
    - why not *OTP* in parentheses?
- titles are well established so no quote marks
- *OTP* and text titles (if abbreviated) go in list of abbreviations

*ANF* and *NPNF*

- *NPNF* 2/12:85–96
- Augustine, *Letters of St. Augustin* 28.3.5 (*NPNF* 1/1:252)
- Augustine, *Letters of St. Augustin* 28.3.5 (trans. J. G. Cunningham, *NPNF* 1/1:252)
- Optional bibliography
    - Eusebius of Caesarea. “The Life of Constantine.” Translated by Ernest
      Cushing Richardson. *NPNF* 2/1:481–559
        - why is this title enquoted and not italic?
            - it's not a book, but a part of a book
                - the book is *Constantine*
                    - the part is "The Life of Constantine"

### Figuring out the rules

- title format
    - default
        - unattributed → roman
        - attributed → italic
    - but sometimes enquoted
        - maybe just override with an entry option?
            - titleformat
                - enquoted
                    - for non standard text titles
                    - for parts of books
                        - or this could be an inancienttext entry type
- list of abbreviations
    - shorttitle
        - includes author if attributed
- there's also the question of the translator
    - sometimes just labelname in parentheses
        - e.g., author, *title* s.d. [labeltranslator]
        - for standard texts
    - sometimes (trans. translator, COLLECTION)
        - maybe we need an intextcollection entry type?
        - what about subsequent citations?
            - use labelname for translator?
    - in SBLHS
        - author, "title", trans. translator (COLLECTION vol:pages)
            - but maybe this is not recommended
                - no examples like this on the blog
- and the question of how the text collection is set
    - sometimes just with commas
        - "title" trans. translator, COLLECTION vol:pages
            - e.g., ANET
    - sometimes in parentheses
        - "title" s.d. (trans. translator, COLLECTION vol:pages)
            - e.g., ANF, NPNF
    - sometimes need to be able to cite just the translator and COLLECTION
        - e.g., (trans. translator, COLLECTION vol:pages)
    - rule assumption
        - if there's a source division, place the translator and COLLECTION in
          parentheses
        - no, this does not follow
            - the Mur. Frag. example has no parentheses but does have s.d.
- and finally the question of what goes in the bibliography and list of
  abbreviations
    - this can be controlled by an xref field which goes into either list
      depending on whether it has a shorthand
- the best option seems to be to use hooks to format the citation, e.g.,
    - `\formatancienttext{usetranslator=false, usecollection=false,
      useparens=true}\cite[prenote][postnote]{key}`
